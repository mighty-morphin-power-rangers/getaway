  aboutMe:"Psychotherapy offers an opportunity to build strength and endurance to face the inevitable challenges and influences in order to move forward with autonomy, confidence, and personal liberation.I will nurture an environment and container of trust and support as you build the relationship and deepen your understanding and sense of self. I believe all people have the innate capacity for understanding the direction their own lives should take; I will join you as you explore and examine the potential blocks standing in the way of living a fuller and more meaningful, authentic life.I have a passion for working with people who may be struggling with their identity, who do not fit the beliefs and expectations held by their family of origin, mainstream culture, and/or the many systems within our society that are inherently designed to oppress and marginalize people who do not conform to these historical and societal restrictions. Many times, the experience of being seen and understood fully by another human being is the core of healing. I offer psychotherapy that fosters curiosity and wonder for each personâ€™s individuality. Other times, it is helpful to sensitively work through past trauma and attachment patterns. Because my counseling approach is existential and humanistic, therapeutic care is tailored to the specific needs of each person. I am well-versed in a variety of psychological tools from diverse therapies, and I use what is best for each client to meet their goals for therapy.",
